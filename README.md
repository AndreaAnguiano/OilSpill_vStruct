# OilSpill_vStruct

## Introduction

> This software was made by the Ocean-Atmosphere Interaction Group of the Center of Atmospheric Sciences, National Autonomous University of Mexico, Mexico City, Mexico.

> In this repository an oil spill particle dispersion model implemented in matlab, is described. The model is based on a Lagrangian particle tracking algorithm with a second-order Runge-Kutta scheme. It uses ocean currents from the Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM), and winds from the Weather Research and (WRF).

> The model considers eight oil components according to their density, and includes multiple types of oil decay: evaporation,
biodegradation, burning, and gathering.
